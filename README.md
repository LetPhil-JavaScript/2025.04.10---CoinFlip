# Coin Flipper

A beginner-friendly digital coin flipping app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed for learning the basics of web development and DOM manipulation in a fun and visual way.

---

## What It Does

- Simulates a coin flip and randomly displays "Heads" or "Tails"
- Shows a short "Flipping" delay to mimic a real coin toss
- Tracks the total number of flips
- Simple interface controlled by a "Flip" button

---

## What You'll Learn

This project introduces core JavaScript concepts:

- DOM manipulation using `querySelector`
- Event handling with `addEventListener`
- Updating content with `innerText`
- Writing and calling JavaScript functions
- Conditional logic using `if/else`
- Generating random outcomes with `Math.random()`
- Delaying actions using `setTimeout()`
- Counting and updating variables

---

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Click the "Flip" button to simulate a coin toss
4. Observe the result after a short delay and track total flips

## Planned Features

These are some upgrades and stretch goals for expanding the project:

- Count how many times Heads and Tails have appeared
- Add Player 1 vs Player 2 turns and name display
- Show a win/lose message based on results
- Add a coin image with flip animation
- Include a reset button to restart the game

---

## Educational Use

This project is used in JavaScript intro classes. It's intentionally simple and easy to expand, providing a hands-on way to understand how real JavaScript applications are built.

## Status

In progress â€” core features are complete and currently used as a teaching tool.
